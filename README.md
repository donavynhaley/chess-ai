# Chess AI Visualizer

I created this project using [Chessboard JSX](https://chessboardjsx.com) and [Chess JS](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js) for the implementing chess. Created a minimax algorithim implemntation with diffrent versions the user can select. After the AI makes a move click view tree to see the overview of the MiniMax tree.
